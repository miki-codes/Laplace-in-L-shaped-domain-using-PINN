# Laplace-in-L-shaped-domain-using-PINN


We use a Physics Informed Neural Network to solve the Laplace equation in a L-shaped domain. A sinusoidal boundary condition is assumed. The partial differential equation and the boundary condition are encoded in the loss function of the PINN. The loss function aims to minimize the interior and the boundary points present in a single loss function. The aim is to train the PINN to get a solution closer to the actual PDE solution. he PINN succeeds in predicting accurate outcomes in low-frequency oscillations but cannot do so for higher-frequency oscillations.

In an alternate approach neural networks are used to obtain solution to partial differential equations using their auto-differentiation property. The physics of the governing equations are encoded as loss functions of the neural network to be minimised by backpropagation during training. The boundary conditions are also accommodated in the neural network error measures. Such network are denoted as Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN). PINNs offer a means solving a wide range of complex partial differential equations governing the fluid flows without the need to devise numerical techniques. often these neural networks require less computational resources to be trained as compared to direct numerical simulations. Use of PINNs in solving fluid flow problems has been increasingly frequent in literature.
